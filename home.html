            <p>
                CompRecCon (Computing Recruitment Conference) was created to help connect students with professionals
                in their industry. This conference features a large selection of companies that support the conference,
                hoping to fill their available job positions!

                Sponsoring companies send their reporesentatives to the conference, where they meet with and talk to
                the candidates. Sponsoring companies can also email the attendees directly outside the event.
