            <p>
                CompRecCon (Computing Recruitment Conference) was created to help connect students with professionals
                in their industry. This conference features a large selection of companies that support the conference,
                hoping to fill their available job positions!
            </p>
            <p>
                Sponsoring companies send their reporesentatives to the conference, where they meet with and talk to
                the candidates. Sponsoring companies can also email the attendees directly outside the event.
